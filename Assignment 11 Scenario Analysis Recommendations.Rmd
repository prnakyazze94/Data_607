1.Who are Amazon's Target Users?

Amazon serves several distinct types of users:

First time visitors exploring products without much browsing or purchase history.

Returning customers who expect familiar, personalized suggestions.

Gift shoppers with short-term, atypical interests.

Prime members who rely heavily on the platform for convenience and tailored experiences.

Amazon also serves an organizational goal of optimizing engagement, sales, and customer retention across billions of interactions daily.

2.What are the target users Key Goals.

To quickly find relevant and trustworthy products.

To discover complementary or new items.

To save time through personalization and convenience.

For gift shoppers, to find appropriate items for others.

2a, What is Amazon’s  goal?

To increase purchase frequency and basket size.

To drive user engagement via personalization loops.

To maintain a scalable recommendation system that performs in real time.

3. How Does the Recommendation System Help Users Achieve These Goals?

Amazon’s recommender system helps users by combining multiple approaches:

Item-Item Collaborative Filtering:
“Customers who bought this also bought…” which finds products similar to those already interacted with.

Content-Based Filtering:
Uses metadata like brand, category, or features to recommend similar products, useful in cold-start situations.

Implicit Feedback Modeling,
Learns from clicks, dwell time, add-to-cart, and purchases instead of explicit ratings.

Latent Factor and Deep Learning Models like Matrix factorization and deep learning uncover hidden patterns in user–item interactions to predict preferences.

These techniques collectively balance personalization, scalability, and recommendation accuracy.

4. User Experience

Users experience recommendations throughout the site through Personalized homepages.

“Frequently bought together” and “Inspired by your browsing history” carousels.

Contextual trust signals such as ratings and reviews.

Amazon continuously evaluates these via A/B testing and offline metrics like RMSE, precision@k, and diversity.

5. Include specific recommendations about how to improve the site's recommendation capabilities going forward. 

Transparency by Showing why a product is recommended (“Because you viewed X”).

Diversity by Injecting serendipity to avoid repetitive suggestions and “filter bubbles.”

Privacy & Control which includes letting users see and adjust what data informs their recommendations.

Dual-Scenario Optimization that separate user-based personalization from organization level business optimization (e.g., balancing personalization with inventory or profit goals).

Conclusion

Amazon’s recommender system exemplifies a robust data science workflow from data acquisition (clickstreams, purchases), cleaning and modeling (collaborative and content-based filtering), to evaluation (A/B testing).
It serves both the users’ goal of discovering relevant products and the organization’s goal of increasing engagement and sales.
By enhancing transparency and control, Amazon can further improve user trust and longterm satisfaction.
